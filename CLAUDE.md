# Dorado Exchange

A precious-metals exchange: customers sell scrap and bullion to the business
(purchase orders) and buy from it (sales orders). Real money, real bank details,
real FedEx labels.

## Layout

pnpm workspace, Node 24, deployed on Railway from `master` with auto-deploy.

```
api/                 @dorado/api        Express, ESM, mostly JavaScript
frontend/            @dorado/frontend   Next.js, TypeScript, strict
packages/contracts/  @dorado/contracts  zod schemas shared by both
```

`api` uses subpath imports — `#features/*`, `#shared/*`, `#providers/*`, `#db`.

## Two things to know before touching the database

**There are two schema designs in the same database.** `exchange` is one flat
schema serving all traffic. `core`, `orders`, `payments`, `fulfillments`,
`shipping`, `refiners`, `tax`, `places`, `auth` are domain-namespaced, built in
a January 2026 refactor abandoned at 3 of 24 features, and are being migrated to
one feature at a time. `leads` and `rates` are done. Use the
`migrate-feature-schema` skill.

**Dev and production are the same Postgres instance**, different databases —
`dorado_db_dev` and `dorado_db`. `DATABASE_URL` in `api/.env` is dev.
`PROD_READONLY_DATABASE_URL` is read-only production, for audits only.

Schema changes go through `api/migrations/*.sql`, applied by
`pnpm --filter @dorado/api migrate`. Never apply to production — leave that to
the user.

## Conventions

**Every query goes through the shared executor**, never `pool.query` directly:

```js
const { rows } = await query(sql, [id], executor);   // executor optional
```

The third argument is what lets a repo call join its caller's transaction.
Getting it wrong broke checkout in August 2026; `pnpm --filter @dorado/api
lint:db` now catches it.

**Transactions use the helper**, never hand-rolled BEGIN/COMMIT:

```js
return withTransaction(async (client) => { ... });
```

**Types come from generated contracts**, never hand-written. After any schema
change, regenerate — see the `verify-changes` skill.

**`NUMERIC` and `BIGINT` parsers are registered in `api/db.js`**, next to the
pool. They must stay there: anything importing the pool without booting the
server otherwise gets strings, and `price + fee` concatenates.

## Verification

`pnpm check` before committing. Several validators need a database and are not
in CI. See the `verify-changes` skill for what each catches.

## Standing constraints

- **Never log or return bank details.** `exchange.payouts` holds routing and
  account numbers in plaintext. Order responses carry only last-4; full values
  come from an admin-only endpoint. Encryption at rest is outstanding.
- **Never change a wire shape** during a schema migration. The frontend is
  coupled to the current API surface; changing it is separate, deliberate work.
- **Never add `NOT NULL` from dev row counts.** Dev holds tens of rows. Use the
  production audit — `pnpm --filter @dorado/api audit:nullability`.
- **Verify before dropping.** `order_metals.percent_change` and `scrap.gem_id`
  are 100% NULL but still referenced by live code.
- `master` auto-deploys. There is no staging.

## Open threads

- Production read role `claude_ro` fails authentication — needs
  `ALTER ROLE claude_ro PASSWORD ...` before the nullability audit can run.
- Bank details are unencrypted at rest.
- 22 features still on `exchange`. `orders` is the big one: `orders.orders`
  unifies purchase and sales orders behind a `direction` discriminator, which is
  what eventually collapses the duplicated tables and composed queries.
- Frontend has no tests.
- Docker images are unverified — no daemon in the dev environment.
