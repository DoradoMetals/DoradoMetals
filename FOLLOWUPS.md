# Follow-ups

Things found and deliberately deferred, with enough context to pick up cold.
Ordered roughly by how much they'd cost if left.

## Production: the schema and eleven features' data can now get there

`000_genesis_schema.sql` creates all 16 schemas, 45 tables, 4 views, 4 enum
types and 1 function from nothing. `029_genesis_backfill.sql` fills the tables
belonging to the eleven migrated features from exchange.

Both are verified by building into renamed schemas inside a rolled-back
transaction: `verify:genesis` compares the structure against dev column by
column, `verify:backfill` runs the backfill into empty tables and compares the
rows, re-runs it to prove idempotency, and checks that it refuses once the new
schema holds a row exchange does not.

Genesis is generated - `pnpm --filter @dorado/api dump:schema`. Edit the
generator, never the SQL.

### What is still not populated

**The other features' tables.** orders, payments, fulfillments,
shipping.shipments/tracking/pickups, places, and the refiners item/spot tables.
Their features still read exchange so empty costs nothing, but each needs
transformation work checked against a read-for-read diff first. They should be
backfilled as each feature is migrated, not in a batch.

**The seed data, which has no source in exchange at all.** These are new facts
about the business rather than a reshaping of old ones, so they cannot be
derived and must be written as literals:

- the DORADO organization (the business itself) and `places.locations` /
  `places.location_hours`, which reference it
- `fulfillments.methods` (11 rows), `payments.methods` (10)
- `shipping.services` (8) and `shipping.packages` (9) - also blocked on the
  product decision below
- `auth.employees` (2)

Worth doing as one seed migration, taking the values from dev. Until then a
production database would have the tables and none of these rows.

### Payments: half unblocked, and the ledger is wrong independent of any migration

The Stripe export landed 2026-08-22 and settled the question of where the truth
lives. It is not `exchange.payment_intents`.

`pnpm --filter @dorado/api audit:payments` compares production's intents against
Stripe. **Seven of the eight settled payments are not recorded as succeeded:**

| intent | Stripe | database |
|---|---|---|
| pi_3SfQTS… | Paid $255.17 | `succeeded` |
| pi_3TuK5t… | Paid $10.00 | `requires_payment_method` |
| pi_3RvkIT… | Paid $51.78 | `requires_payment_method` |
| pi_3RcYBY… | Paid $64.70 | `requires_payment_method` |
| pi_3RgCh9… | Refunded $1248.37 | no row |
| pi_3RcYBR… | Refunded $434.00 | no row |
| pi_3RcVdp… | Paid $114.80 | no row |
| pi_3RcV9l… | Paid $0.50 | no row |

$2,179.32 charged and $1,682.37 refunded across those eight. The export holds 45
intents; 20 of them have no row in `exchange` at all. Only 2 of production's 25
intents link to an order, and none to a purchase order.

**This is the current system being wrong, not the migration.** It went unnoticed
because the order lifecycle never consults this table — orders complete
regardless — but it means the application cannot answer "was this order paid
for" from its own data. Worth fixing on its own merits.

**What was built.** `payments.stripe_charges` (migration 054), seeded by 055
from the export via `scripts/dump-stripe-reconciliation.mjs`. The reconciliation
arrives as its own table rather than as a correction applied to `exchange`,
because correcting `exchange` would mean an `UPDATE` against the one schema that
must stay untouched, and because a visible disagreement can be audited where a
silent fix cannot. Reversible: `DROP TABLE payments.stripe_charges` loses
nothing that is not in the Stripe dashboard.

It deliberately holds no personal data — no cardholder name, billing address or
card last4 — so the reconciliation is reproducible from the repo without the
export's personal data entering git. The CSVs themselves are gitignored.

Timestamps are emitted as `::timestamp AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` rather than cast
straight to `timestamptz`, which would have read them in whatever timezone the
person applying the migration happened to have. Verified by reading the same row
from three session timezones.

**Who the seven belong to.** `audit:payments` now walks each settled charge back
to a user through `exchange.users.stripeCustomerId`, and from there to their
sales orders. Six of the eight resolve to a user; three tie to a specific order:

| charge | amount | user | order |
|---|---|---|---|
| pi_3SfQTS… | $255.17 | `0c1dbd9f…` | #62 — exact |
| pi_3RcYBY… | $64.70 | `3a4fffbb…` | #55 — exact |
| pi_3RgCh9… | $1248.37 refunded | `148b2cc0…` | #58 ($1248.58) — within 1%, wants confirming |
| pi_3RvkIT… | $51.78 | `289f6d31…` | their only order is #61 at $3534.53 — not a match |
| pi_3TuK5t… | $10.00 | `422b1c08…` | no sales orders at all |
| pi_3RcYBR… | $434.00 refunded | `3ad23094…` | no sales orders at all |
| pi_3RcVdp… | $114.80 | — | no exchange user carries `cus_SXaL4qR7SGg8OD` |
| pi_3RcV9l… | $0.50 | — | no exchange user carries `cus_SXaKVDtOlduH4J` |

The last two are the two earliest charges on the account, both 21 June 2025, and
per the export they belong to the same person as the `jaketjohnson97` customer —
i.e. Jacob's own, almost certainly setting the integration up. They are the
least interesting of the eight.

The one worth a look is **pi_3RvkIT… at $51.78**, an ACH payment whose user's
only order is $3534.53. Either a partial payment, or a charge against something
the orders table does not describe.

Amount matching is tiered deliberately: within a cent is a match, within one
percent is reported as likely and flagged for a human, and anything beyond that
is not claimed. A flat one-cent tolerance would have missed order #58, and a
loose one would have claimed #61.

**What is still not done.** Deriving `payments.intents` / `.attempts` /
`.settlements` from `exchange` joined to this table. That means designing the
transformation and replacing the 70 placeholder rows production already holds,
which is a decision about money rather than a mechanical step. `payments.details`
stays untouched until the encryption question is answered — see below.

### BLOCKED: payments is a different model, not a reshaped one

Audited. The new payments schema is not a copy of exchange with the columns
rearranged - it is a different design, populated in January with data that does
not correspond to what exchange holds.

- **No id is shared.** None of payments.details, .methods, .intents, .attempts
  or .settlements shares a single id with exchange.payouts or
  exchange.payment_intents.
- **The granularity differs.** exchange.payment_intents holds 21 rows across 8
  distinct orders - several Stripe attempts per order. payments.intents holds
  28, roughly one per order, with attempts and settlements hanging off them
  one to one. Only 2 of the 28 attempts carry a provider_ref matching a real
  Stripe payment_intent_id.
- So the 28 rows are not a reference to copy from. Migrating means designing
  the transformation from scratch - 21 Stripe intents across 8 orders becoming
  intents, attempts and settlements - and then *replacing* what is there, which
  means deleting rows in the new schema. That is a decision, not a mechanical
  step.

The model itself looks better than exchange's: separating what was intended,
what was attempted and what settled is the right shape for payment data. But
the mapping is a design question about money, and the existing rows would have
to go.

payments.methods (10 rows) is seed data with no exchange source, and belongs
with the seed migration below.

### 35 populated columns still have no home, and they are now known in advance

`pnpm --filter @dorado/api audit:coverage` reports, for every source table,
which populated columns have no destination in the schema it maps onto. It was
written because orders turned out to be missing twenty-one columns of live data,
found one repo function at a time, after the row counts had matched and the
shapes looked plausible.

The eleven migrated features are clean. What remains, to be fixed *before* each
feature's repo is split rather than during it:

- **shipping — 13 columns.** `exchange.shipments` has essentially nothing mapped:
  shipping_status, service_type, type, carrier_id, package, pickup_type,
  net_charge, shipping_label, estimated_delivery, created_at and both order id
  columns, all populated. Plus `tracking_events.scan_time`, 72 of 72. The
  shipping tables are the emptiest sketch of the lot.
- **payments — 18 columns.** `payment_intents` is almost entirely unmapped
  (payment_intent_id, payment_status, type, user_id, amounts, and the card and
  bank descriptors), and `payouts` is missing order_id, method,
  account_holder_name and cost.
- **refiners — 4 columns**, the same four added to orders.spots by 035:
  scrap_percentage, bullion_percentage, created_at, updated_at. Migration 035
  already added them to `refiners.spots`; they are listed here because the
  refiners feature has not been backfilled yet, so its table is still empty.

The audit only proves a mapping *exists*, not that it is right. It is a floor.

### When addresses is promoted, orders should return the snapshot id

The order reads return `orders.addresses.source_address_id` - the address-book
row an order was placed against - rather than the snapshot's id, because the
frontend posts it back at checkout and `getAddressFromId` resolved it against
`exchange.addresses`. Tests in both order features pin that.

Under `ADDRESSES_SOURCE=dual` that still works, and not by luck: the address
book kept its exchange ids, so the same id resolves in `places.addresses`. But
once addresses is promoted, the better answer is for the order to return the
*snapshot* id. The snapshot is the address that order was actually sent to,
frozen at the time; the address-book row is whatever the customer has edited it
into since.

Deliberately not done in the same change as the addresses split - it alters
what two order reads return, and those have their own tests. Do it as its own
commit, with the order diffs re-run.

### The order address id is the address-book id, not the snapshot's

`orders.addresses` points at a snapshot in `places.addresses` and also records
`source_address_id`, the address-book row it was copied from. The order read
returns the source id, because the frontend posts `address.id` back at checkout
and the API resolves it with `addressService.getAddressFromId`, which reads
`exchange.addresses`. A snapshot id does not resolve there.

That is right for now and wrong eventually. Once the addresses feature moves and
`getAddressFromId` reads `places.addresses`, the snapshot id should become the
one returned - it is the address the order was actually placed against, frozen.
Revisit when places is migrated; there is a test pinning the current behaviour.

### shipping_service now exists twice, and may want to exist once

`orders.transactions.shipping_service` was added by 041 because the sales order
read returns it and the wire shape may not change. It sits beside the shipping
cost, which is where exchange kept it.

`shipping.shipments.service_type` holds what looks like the same thing. Whether
they are one field is still open and still tangled up with the
`shipping.services` question below - `exchange.shipments.service_type` contains
values `carrier_services` does not.

If the shipping migration concludes they are the same, this is the column to
drop. That was the deliberate choice: dropping a duplicate later is a much
easier conversation than recovering a column that was never carried across.

### BLOCKED: fulfillments is blocked behind shipping, exactly

A fulfillment is derived from a shipment, and the dependency is one-to-one:

- all 17 orders that have a fulfillment have a shipment in `exchange`
- the 6 orders that have a shipment but *no* fulfillment are precisely the 6
  whose shipments were never copied into `shipping.shipments`
- all 16 `fulfillments.shipments` links resolve, because they can only point at
  shipments that were copied

So the missing fulfillments are not a separate gap; they are the shipping gap
seen from the other side, and they close when shipping does.

The method mapping is clean and worth recording: `exchange.shipments.pickup_type`
'Store Dropoff' becomes CARRIER DROPOFF, 'DropShip' becomes DROPSHIP.

One row needs its own look: there are 17 fulfillments and 16 shipment links, and
the odd one has method APPOINTMENT — but `fulfillments.directs` and
`fulfillments.pickups` are both empty, so nothing backs it.

### BLOCKED: auth cannot be dual-written, because better-auth owns the writes

`features/auth/client.js` configures better-auth with
`modelName: 'exchange.users'`, `'exchange.session'`, `'exchange.account'` and
`'exchange.verification'`, and better-auth writes those tables through its own
pool - not through `#db`, not through the shared executor, not through any repo.

So there is no dual-write to build. Migrating auth means changing those four
`modelName` values, which is an atomic cutover of live authentication with no
reversible middle state. Everything else in this migration goes through `dual`
precisely to avoid that shape of change; auth cannot.

Worth noting separately: better-auth's pool bypasses the NUMERIC and INT8 type
parsers registered in `api/db.js`, so anything it reads comes back with
different types than the rest of the codebase would give.

`auth.users` is already backfilled by 029 and `auth.employees` by the seed, so
the data is there whenever the cutover happens. The 2 sessions and 2 accounts
the new schema has that exchange does not belong to test users created directly
in January.

### BLOCKED: refiners needs the same answer as a purchase order's refiner

`refiners.spots` (124 rows) and `refiners.items` (40) both carry a NOT NULL
`refiner_id`, and every row in both points at Elemetal.
`exchange.refiner_metals` and `exchange.purchase_order_items` have no refiner
column at all, so there is nothing to derive it from - it is the same fact
someone knew in January that `orders.orders.refinery_id` needs, and the same
decision answers both.

Unlike the orders case, null is not an option here: the column is NOT NULL, so
a backfill must assert *some* refiner for every row.

The columns are otherwise fine - `audit:coverage refiners` is clean, since
migration 035 added the four it was missing. It is only the identity that is
unknown.

Moving refiners also means giving it its own feature folder: its five repo
functions currently live in `features/purchase-orders/`, which is exactly the
mixing that should not happen.

### A purchase order's refiner is not recorded in exchange

`orders.orders.refinery_id` is set on all sixteen purchase orders in dev, all to
Elemetal. `exchange.purchase_orders` has no supplier column, and
`exchange.refiner_metals` has none either, so there is nothing to derive it
from - it is a fact someone knew in January and wrote down.

The backfill leaves it null for purchases rather than asserting Elemetal of
every purchase order on production because it happened to be true of sixteen in
dev. Sales orders are fine: they carry `supplier_id` and it maps straight
across.

Needs a decision. If every purchase order really does go to one refiner, say so
and the backfill can set it; if not, it is only recoverable from whatever
records exist outside the database.

### reviews.user_id cannot be reconstructed

`exchange.reviews` records a name and no user reference. dev's `reviews.user_id`
was filled in January by matching that name, but exchange.users now holds two
accounts named Jacob Johnson and every review in dev is under that name, so the
match is ambiguous and the backfill leaves it null rather than guessing. If the
link matters, it needs a deliberate decision about which account is the
reviewer - it is not recoverable from the data.

### CRITICAL: genesis cannot build production, because production is half-built

`000_genesis_schema.sql` creates every table with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
— 331 of them — and declares `-- baseline: 002-049`, which tells the runner to
stamp migrations 002 through 049 as applied rather than replay them.

That is correct for an empty database and correct for dev. It is wrong for
production, which is neither.

Production already holds nine of the sixteen schemas, built directly in January
and never migrated since: `auth, checkout, fulfillments, orders, payments,
places, refiners, shipping, tax`. Their tables are in January's shape. Measured
against dev, within those nine schemas alone:

- **50 columns absent**, all added by migrations 002–049
- **2 tables absent** — `refiners.exchange_compat`,
  `shipping.carriers_exchange_compat`

```
orders.transactions   13  waive_payout_fee, pool_remediation, used_funds,
                          pool_oz_deducted, shipping_service, updated_by_id, …
orders.items           6  price, content_actual, post_melt_actual,
                          purity_actual, bid_premium, refiner_premium
orders.orders          4  order_sent, tracking_updated, created_by_id, updated_by_id
orders.spots           4  bullion_percentage, scrap_percentage, created_at, updated_at
refiners.spots         4  bullion_percentage, scrap_percentage, created_at, updated_at
shipping.shipments     3  shipping_status, pickup_type, created_at
orders.offers          3  offer_sent_at, created_by_id, updated_by_id
shipping.services      2  created_by_id, updated_by_id
fulfillments.methods   2  created_by_id, updated_by_id
fulfillments.fulfillments 2  created_by_id, updated_by_id
payments.methods       2  created_by_id, updated_by_id
payments.details       2  created_by_id, updated_by_id
payments.intents       2  created_by_id, updated_by_id
orders.addresses       1  source_address_id
```

Run against production today, the sequence would be:

1. 000 creates the seven missing schemas and their tables correctly.
2. 000 **skips all 38 tables production already has** — `IF NOT EXISTS`.
3. The baseline marker stamps 002–049 as applied. They never run.
4. Those 50 columns are never added, and the 2 tables never created.
5. 050 onward run against tables missing the columns they write to.

So the backfills would write into a shape that cannot hold what they carry.
`034` — the migration that exists specifically to backfill the 21 order columns
`033` added — would be marked done without ever having run.

**Why nothing caught it.** `verify:genesis` builds into *renamed empty* schemas
and compares against dev. Building from nothing is exactly the case where
`IF NOT EXISTS` is invisible. Production is the one starting state that has
never been tested: partially built, older, and non-empty.

**FIXED 2026-08-22, for the schema half.** `dump-schema.mjs` now emits an
`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` for every column alongside the
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so genesis reconciles an existing table instead of
skipping it. `NOT NULL` is deliberately left off those: adding it to a table
that already holds rows fails if any are null, and nullability is decided from
the production audit, not from dev.

`pnpm --filter @dorado/api verify:genesis:production` is the check. It reads
production's real shape read-only, builds genesis into scratch schemas in dev,
winds them back to production's shape, runs genesis again, and compares against
dev — all inside a rolled-back transaction. It failed before the change and
passes after.

Worth recording what the failure actually was, because it was better than
feared: genesis did not silently skip the columns, it **aborted** on the first
`ADD CONSTRAINT` naming a column production's older table lacks. Postgres has no
`IF NOT EXISTS` for `ADD CONSTRAINT`, and the runner wraps each migration in a
transaction — so production would have rolled back untouched rather than ending
up half-built. The migration could not run, rather than running wrongly.

**Still needed before any production migration:**

- A verification that starts from production's real shape rather than from
  empty. The shape can be read read-only and reproduced in dev inside a
  rolled-back transaction.
- Genesis reconciling existing tables instead of skipping them — an
  `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` for every column, generated by
  `dump-schema.mjs` alongside the `CREATE TABLE`. Additive, so it cannot drop
  anything that is already there.
- The `pg_dump` first, in any case.

Found 2026-08-22, once `claude_ro` was granted `USAGE` on the new schemas.
Until that grant, production's new schemas were unreadable and this was
invisible.

### RETRACTED: the three new-schema-only orders are cancelled orders, not unpaid ones

An earlier version of this file said purchase order 299 was a customer owed for
100 troy ounces delivered on 2026-01-02 and never paid. **That was wrong.** It is
recorded here rather than deleted, because it was stated forcefully and acted on.

What was right: the tracking is real. A package was dropped at FedEx in
Crossville TN on 2025-12-30, moved Cookeville → Memphis → Dallas → Irving, and
was delivered to Irving TX on 2026-01-02. Fifteen scans. That is a real
shipment and it really arrived.

What was wrong: concluding from `exchange` not having the order that `exchange`
had *never* had it. Orders 298 and 299 carry exactly the profile of order 297,
which is still in `exchange` — one address snapshot, one item, four spots, one
offer. Those snapshots are created by the migration **reading `exchange`**, so
all three orders were in `exchange` when it ran and were deleted from it
afterwards. Their shipments and tracking rows went with them, which is why
`shipping.shipments` holds three rows `exchange.shipments` does not.

Jacob's account, which fits every field better than mine did: the business
occasionally receives fake metal, and those orders are cancelled and deleted.

| field | read as "unpaid customer" | read as "rejected as fake" |
|---|---|---|
| `purity 0.000`, `content 0.000` | never assayed | assayed, worth nothing |
| `confirmed: true` | — | someone did check it |
| `status: Received` | arrived, unprocessed | arrived, processed, rejected |
| no payout, no transaction | customer unpaid | nothing to pay for |
| absent from `exchange` | never written there | cancelled and deleted |

**The general rule this violated.** A row missing from `exchange` has two
explanations — it was never there, or it was deleted — and only one of them was
considered. The same mistake as the "orphan duplicate" addresses earlier the
same evening: reading one table and inferring history from its current contents.
`exchange` is authoritative for what exists *now*; it is not a log of what
existed.

**What this means for the backfill guards.** Nothing changes. `audit:guards`
still reports that two would refuse, and they still should: re-deriving
`orders.orders` from `exchange` would delete rows that record cancelled
business. Whether those rows are kept or dropped before promotion is a decision,
but it is a bookkeeping decision rather than an urgent one.

**Worth one check on Jacob's side, and only one.** The retraction rests on the
orders having been deleted from `exchange` deliberately. If any of 298, 299 or
303 was *not* a deliberate cancellation, the original reading would apply to it.
That is a memory question, not a data one.

### FOR JACOB: three production purchase orders exist only in the new schema

Not a code question. Three purchase orders live in `orders.orders` on production
and in neither `exchange.purchase_orders` nor `exchange.sales_orders`, which
means **the live application cannot see them** — it reads `exchange`.

| number | created | status | pre-melt | purity | content |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 298 | 2025-12-24 | In Transit | 141.096 | 0.925 | 130.514 |
| 299 | 2025-12-30 | Received | 100.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| 303 | 2026-01-12 | In Transit | 130.000 | 0.925 | 120.250 |

ids `5f211253-…`, `a678721b-…`, `e91da7f0-…`.

What is known:

- All three users **exist in `exchange.users`** and each has an address there.
- None of the three users has **any** purchase order in `exchange` — these are
  their only ones.
- Each order has one scrap item, one fulfillment, and one `payments.intents` row.
- Order 303 has a shipment with a tracking number and a tracking event.
- No `exchange.payouts` row for any of the three users.
- All three were created between 2025-12-24 and 2026-01-12 — the window the
  January refactor was being worked on.
- `exchange`'s purchase order numbering has 87 gaps between 192 and 339, so a
  gap on its own proves nothing. 298, 299 and 303 sit in those gaps.

Two readings, and the data does not settle it:

- **Real.** Three customers submitted scrap, two consignments are marked in
  transit and one received, and nobody has been paid because the orders
  disappeared from the live system when the January work was abandoned. 141 and
  130 troy ounces of sterling are not trivial amounts.
- **Test.** They were created during development against real accounts. Order
  299 having purity 0.000 and content 0.000 fits an incomplete test entry, and
  none of the three users has any other order.

**Someone who was there has to say which.** If they are real, three customers
are owed an answer and possibly money, and that is independent of any migration.
If they are test rows, they should be deleted from the new schema before
promotion — deliberately, with the reason recorded.

Until that is answered, `pnpm --filter @dorado/api audit:guards` reports that
two backfill guards would refuse on production, which is the guard working
correctly: re-deriving those tables from `exchange` would overwrite these rows.

### Production's new schemas already hold rows exchange has never seen

The backfill guard refuses when the target holds rows the source does not.
That has been theoretical, checked only against dev. It is production's actual
state:

| source | rows | target | rows | orphans in target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| exchange.addresses | 72 | places.addresses | 118 | 60 |
| exchange.payment_intents | 25 | payments.intents | 70 | 45 |
| exchange.shipments | 70 | shipping.shipments | 44 | 3 |
| exchange.users | 74 | auth.users | 60 | 0 |
| exchange.tracking_events | 525 | shipping.tracking | 427 | — |

Divergence runs both ways: exchange also holds rows the new schema lacks —
14 addresses, 29 shipments, 14 users, 116 tracking events — which is what the
backfills are for.

**CORRECTION — the 60 orphan addresses are not duplicates and must not be
deleted.** An earlier version of this note called them "re-keyed duplicates" and
"junk to clean up after promotion", on the evidence that 59 of the 60 match an
`exchange.addresses` row on `(line_1, city, zip)`. That evidence was real and
the conclusion drawn from it was wrong.

They are **order address snapshots**. `orders.addresses` holds exactly 59 rows,
and all 59 point at one of these — none points at an `exchange.addresses` row.
A snapshot is *supposed* to carry the same values under a fresh id: that is what
makes it a record of where an order was actually sent, rather than a pointer to
an address book entry the customer may since have edited or deleted. The value
match that looked like duplication is the snapshot doing its job.

The 60th, `1d37f973…`, is not a customer address at all — it is a
`places.locations` row, one of the business's own addresses, and it is on a
shipment.

So **zero of the 60 are safe to delete**, and a cleanup migration would have
destroyed the delivery address of every order in the new schema. 050's guard
already said as much in a comment — *"Snapshots are excluded from that check,
they are created by the orders backfill and have no counterpart by design"* —
which was there to be read before the count was interpreted.

What made this look like a duplicate was reading `places.addresses` alone.
Nothing about a row is legible without asking what points at it.

**The 3 orphan shipments are not artifacts.** All three carry a tracking
number, a fulfillment link and tracking events. They do not overlap dev's
(dev now has none), so they are production rows that `exchange` never recorded.
Someone should establish what they are before promotion — they are the only
rows found so far that exist solely in the new schema and look real.

### Carrier pickup has never worked, at any point in the chain

Six defects, found over two sessions, all in the path that books a FedEx pickup
for a purchase order. Listed in the order they fire:

1. `handler.createPickup` called `provider.schedulePickup(...)`. `fedex.js`
   exports `createPickup` and has never exported `schedulePickup`, so this threw
   `provider.schedulePickup is not a function` **before any FedEx request was
   built or sent**. Eight of the nine dispatch lines named their export
   correctly; the ninth did not.
2. `payloads.js` called `normalizeTime`, `formatFedexFullDateTime` and
   `addHours` without importing any of them. All three exist in
   `providers/fedex/utils/formatting.js`; only `formatFedexTime` was imported.
   `ReferenceError` on the first line that used one.
3. `cancelPickupInput` read `confirmation_number` and `pickup_requested_at`
   while its only caller passes `confirmationCode` and `pickupDate`. Both
   arrived `undefined`, so FedEx was asked to cancel a pickup without being told
   which one. This is the only one of the six that did not throw.
4. `pickups/repo.js` inserted a `shipment_id` column `exchange.carrier_pickups`
   does not have — `42703` on every write, which is why the table is empty in
   dev and production.
5. `cancelPickup` set `status`, and the repo reads `pickup_status`, so
   cancelling wrote the row's existing status straight back.
6. It set `"cancelled"`, and a CHECK constraint allows only
   `pending / scheduled / completed / canceled`. One `l`.

**A correction to what was written earlier.** The first version of this note said
the throw happened *after* `shippingOps.createPickup` had booked a real pickup
with FedEx, leaving orphaned bookings nobody had a record of. That was wrong.
Defect 1 fires first, before the payload is built and before any request is
sent, so **no FedEx pickup was ever booked through this path**. There is nothing
orphaned at FedEx to reconcile.

All six are fixed. `features/shipping/operations/adapters/fedex.test.js` and
`resolver.test.js` cover the chain, including a test that reads the dispatch
lines back out of `handler.js` and asserts every method exists on every
registered provider — which is what defect 1 was, and what TypeScript cannot
catch because `provider` is a namespace import resolved at runtime.

### Two more ReferenceErrors, found by turning on checkJs

`pnpm --filter @dorado/api typecheck:sweep` runs `tsc` with `--checkJs` and
`--noImplicitAny false`. The first flag checks the JavaScript; the second
suppresses 1,631 "parameter implicitly has an any type" complaints that are
noise rather than signal. What was left was 107 errors, of which five were
`TS2304` — an identifier that does not exist, which is a guaranteed
`ReferenceError`:

- `features/scrap/service.js` — `deleteItems({ ids })` called
  `scrapRepo.deleteItems(orderId)`. `orderId` was never defined.
- `features/suppliers/service.js` — `getSupplierFromId(ids)` called
  `supplierRepo.getSupplierFromId(id)`. `id` was never defined.
- the three missing imports in `providers/fedex/payloads.js` above.

All fixed; `TS2304` is now zero. The remaining ~55 are known-benign categories
and are listed here so a future sweep can tell new signal from old noise:

| code | count | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| TS2345 | 16 | argument shapes inferred from the widest call site — e.g. `renderTemplate` defaults `offerExpiration`, so callers omitting it are fine |
| TS2339 | 13 | `err.status` / `err.statusCode` on `Error`, the usual JS idiom for attaching an HTTP status |
| TS2307 | 8 | `better-auth` ships no type declarations |
| TS18046 | 6 | `err` is `unknown` in a `catch` |
| others | 12 | inference noise on destructured defaults |

`checkJs` is deliberately **not** enabled in `tsconfig.json`. Turning it on would
fail `pnpm check` on those 55, and annotating them away is churn with no
behaviour change. The sweep is a tool to run deliberately, not a gate.

## Security

### The audit trail is forgeable — and the fix is server-only

The frontend sends `user_name: user?.name` in the request body, and the API
writes it to `created_by` / `updated_by` verbatim. Any authenticated admin can
attribute an action to anyone by editing one field.

`req.user.id` and `req.user.name` are already available from `requireAuth` and
are used for audit in **zero** places.

**No frontend change is needed.** The server keeps accepting the field and
simply stops trusting it — read the actor from the session instead. The
frontend can go on sending `user_name`; it just gets ignored. 53 call sites
across 23 API files pass `user_name` today.

Until this is done, the new `created_by_id` columns are a trustworthy column
filled from an untrusted source.

### Bank details are unencrypted at rest, and production has real ones

**Confirmed against production, 2026-08-22.** Dev suggested these columns were
vestigial. They are not.

```
ECHECK            41 payouts,  0 routing,  0 account
ACH               10 payouts,  7 routing,  7 account
WIRE               8 payouts,  7 routing,  7 account
DORADO_ACCOUNT     2 payouts,  0 routing,  0 account
                  61 total
```

Fourteen payouts carry a real routing and account number in plaintext `text`,
written straight from `req.body` by `insertPayout`. Dev has sixty-one fewer
payouts and zero bank details, which is why the earlier note here suggested
dropping the columns rather than encrypting them. That was wrong, and it is
exactly the trap CLAUDE.md warns about: dev row counts prove nothing.

So encryption at rest is real work, not a delete:

- **The migration must not copy them.** `payments.details` has
  `routing_number` and `account_number` columns and holds nothing in either.
  Backfilling them would put the same fourteen secrets in a second table and
  double the exposure. Whatever the payments migration does, it should encrypt
  on the way across or leave them where they are.
- Order responses already carry last-4 only, with full values behind an
  admin-only endpoint. That part is sound and there is a test asserting it.
- `pgcrypto` is the obvious mechanism, but key management is the actual
  decision: a key in the same environment as the database buys very little.

## Schema

### The API doesn't populate the new audit id columns

`created_by_id` / `updated_by_id` exist on 14 new-schema tables and are
backfilled, but dual-write only mirrors the text columns, so new rows get null.
Ties into the session-actor fix above — do them together.

### Production is now readable, and it moved two conclusions

`claude_ro` works. `PROD_READONLY_DATABASE_URL` connects, read-only, for audits.
Two things followed immediately, both recorded in their own entries: production
holds fourteen plaintext bank details where dev holds none, and
`audit:nullability` had been reading dev all along.

`audit:coverage --prod` now counts population against production while taking
the schema shape from dev, because the new schema exists nowhere else. That
closed a real hole: the audit skips any column that is null on every row, and
run against dev it was excusing every column dev happens not to use.

Checked, and it had not bitten — **no column is populated on production that dev
missed**. Two go the other way: `payment_intents.bank_account_type` and
`.routing` are dev-only test data. Production reports 22 gaps against dev's 24.

Also re-verified against production, since both govern live decisions:

- `order_metals.percent_change` and `.dollar_change` are null on all 284 rows,
  so the orders read projecting NULL for them is correct rather than lucky
- `scrap.gem_id` is null on all 105
- `exchange.metals.scrap_percentage` and `.bullion_percentage` **are** populated
  on production, so the `DELIBERATE` waiver in audit-coverage rests on nothing
  reading them rather than on their being empty — which is still true: the only
  reference in the codebase is a comment in `spots/repo.exchange.js` saying so

### deleteOrphanScrap runs on every cart sync and is not scoped to the customer

`syncSellCart` ends with `cartRepo.deleteOrphanScrap(client)`, and that function
deletes **every** row in `exchange.scrap` not referenced by a `sell_cart_items`
or a `purchase_order_items` row — across the whole table, not the syncing
customer's. It runs each time anyone changes their sell cart.

That is its intended job, and in practice it is safe today: every path that
creates a scrap row attaches it to a cart item or an order item inside the same
transaction, so another customer's scrap is never visibly unreferenced.

What is worth knowing is the blast radius. `NOT IN` over two subqueries that
return nothing is true for every row, so if `sell_cart_items` and
`purchase_order_items` were ever both empty — a bad migration, a failed restore,
a truncate someone meant to scope — **the next cart sync would empty the scrap
table**. On production that is 105 rows carrying `purity_actual`,
`post_melt_actual` and `content_actual`: the record of what a customer's parcel
actually turned out to weigh once melted, which exists nowhere else. There is a
test asserting the current behaviour, so a guard added later will fail it
loudly rather than silently.

`lint:migrations` protects `exchange` from destructive *migrations*. Nothing
protects it from application code doing an unbounded `DELETE`, and this is the
only one that does.

Two cheap options if it is worth hardening: refuse when both reference sets are
empty, or scope the delete to the scrap ids the sync itself orphaned. Both change
checkout behaviour, so neither was done on a hunch.

### The sales tax enums live in `public`, not `exchange`

`exchange.sales_tax_rules.metal_category` and `.product_type` are typed by enums
in the **public** schema, not in `exchange`. The January refactor created
same-named enums in `tax`, which is why the genesis backfill casts through text
to move values between them.

Nothing is wrong with it, but three same-named types across three schemas is a
trap for anyone writing a cast — an `exchange.`-qualified one simply fails, and
a `tax.`-qualified one fails in the other direction. The repo tests state which
is which.

### content_actual is written as zero when there is no assay

`updateScrapItem` computes `content_actual` as

```js
convertTroyOz(post_melt_actual ?? pre_melt, gross_unit) * purity_actual ?? content
```

which parses as `(convert(...) * purity_actual) ?? content`, because `*` binds
tighter than `??`. The intended fallback to `content` can therefore never fire:
`??` catches only null and undefined, and a multiplication returns neither.

Multiplying by a null `purity_actual` gives **0**, so an admin editing a scrap
row that has no assay yet lands `purity_actual = purity` (correct, that fallback
is a plain `??`) alongside `content_actual = 0`, which disagrees with it. 49 of
production's 105 scrap rows have a null `purity_actual`, so they are all in that
state waiting for an edit.

The same expression yields **NaN** if a figure is `undefined` rather than null,
and Postgres stores NaN in a `numeric` column without complaint. Production has
none today.

Not fixed, because the fix depends on what the row should claim: `content_actual`
falling back to `content` asserts an assay that never happened, and leaving it
null says the parcel has not been melted yet. That is a question about the
business, not about JavaScript. A test pins the current behaviour either way.

### createPaymentIntent writes twice around a network call

`stripe/service.js::createPaymentIntent` creates a Stripe customer, writes
`stripeCustomerId` to the user, then creates a payment intent and writes that —
three steps, two of them database writes, with a network call between them.

It is not wrapped in a transaction and mostly cannot be: a Stripe customer
cannot be rolled back, so holding a database transaction open across the call
would only widen the window in which it is held. The failure mode is a Stripe
customer created without `stripeCustomerId` being saved, which the next call
recovers from by creating a second customer — untidy rather than harmful.

Left alone deliberately, unlike the two purchase-order services that were
wrapped, because those are pure database work and this is not.

### Deleting scrap silently orphans an order line

`purchase_order_items.scrap_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so `scrapRepo.deleteItems`
succeeds on scrap belonging to an order. The line survives with neither a
`scrap_id` nor a `product_id` — which the composed order query reports as
`item_type: 'unknown'` — and the weights, purity and assay figures are gone.
That is the record of what a customer sent and what was recovered from it, and
it exists nowhere else.

Production has no such line today: 81 scrap-backed and 7 product-backed of 88.
Latent rather than live, and pinned by a test. A guard would change what an
admin delete does, which is why one was not added.

### The customer balance can go negative

`removeFunds` does not check the balance before subtracting, so a checkout that
spends more than a customer holds leaves them negative rather than failing.
Whether the guard belongs in the repo, the service or a database constraint is a
real decision; it is pinned as current behaviour by a test rather than changed.

### Writes that accept an executor and never use it

Found by auditing every write in every repo rather than by a failure. One was
live and is fixed; the rest are latent and will bite whoever migrates those
features.

**Fixed:** `deleteRate` in both `features/rates/repo.exchange.js` and
`repo.next.js` declared an `executor` parameter and never passed it to
`query()`. The dual layer threaded it correctly, so under
`RATES_SOURCE=dual` a delete would have run on the pool on *both* sides —
committing immediately, outside the caller's transaction, leaving a rate deleted
from both schemas even when the surrounding operation rolled back. There is now
a test.

**Now done.** All ten remaining writes take an executor as their last parameter
and thread it into `query()`: `changePayoutMethod`, `purgeCancelled` and
`updateRefinerSpot` in purchase-orders; `updateScrapItem` and `deleteItems` in
scrap; `createPaymentIntent`, `updatePaymentIntent`, `updateMethod` and
`attachCustomerToUser` in stripe; `adjustUserCredit` in users. Call sites are
unchanged — the parameter is optional and `undefined` still means "use the
pool", which is the behaviour they had.

Every write in every repo now accepts an executor and passes it on.

Checked and *fine*: `features/transactions/repo.js` `addFunds` and `removeFunds`
both take a client, so the checkout path that moves a customer's balance is
already transaction-safe.

### Two behaviours the frontend tests pin rather than fix

Both are recorded because they are defensible as they stand, and both would be
easy to change by accident.

**A missing premium means opposite things for scrap and for a product.** In
`getReturnDeclaredValue`, a scrap line with no premium anywhere falls back to
`1` and is declared at full spot; a product line falls back to `0` and is
declared at nothing. Neither is obviously wrong - scrap is bought at a discount
that defaults to none, and a product without a premium has no price - but they
are different rules and the difference is invisible at the call site.

**An unknown weight unit is worth zero, in both JS copies.** `convertTroyOz`
returns 0 for a unit it does not recognise; the SQL function returns NULL. Zero
is the more dangerous answer, because a scrap line in an unanticipated unit is
silently worth nothing and nothing about the result says it failed. Nothing
calls the SQL function today, so this is latent rather than live.

**`formatPhoneNumber` and `normalizePhone` disagree on a leading 1.**
`normalizePhone` strips it only when there are eleven digits — a country code.
`formatPhoneNumber` strips it whenever the string starts with 1, so ten digits
beginning with 1 lose their first digit and render as nine: `1234567890` becomes
`(234) 567-890`. No real US number hits this, because NANP area codes cannot
begin with 0 or 1. Both functions are applied to the same values and only one is
right about the rule, so it is pinned rather than left to be discovered.

**`getProductPrice` throws on a missing product where its three siblings return
zero.** `getProductBidPrice`, `getProductBidOverUnderSpot` and
`getProductAskOverUnderSpot` all guard both arguments; `getProductPrice` guards
only the spot and its signature says the product is required. The inconsistency
invites the assumption that all four are safe to call with partial data.

**Dates rendered in the browser can disagree with dates rendered by the API.**
The API pins `TZ=UTC`; the browser formats in the customer's zone. An instant
just before midnight UTC is the previous day for anyone in the Americas. This is
normally what you want from a UI, but it means two dates on the same screen can
differ by a day depending on which side rendered them.

### Latent defects in `exchange`, not worth fixing there

Recorded because the same mistakes should not be carried into the new schema:

- `exchange.addresses.state` defaults to `'United States'`; `country` has no
  default. The pair is transposed. No rows affected — the app always supplies
  both — and `places.addresses` already has it the right way round.
- `exchange.leads.contact` defaults to the literal `'Jacob Johnson'`.
- `order_metals.percent_change` and `dollar_change` are 100% NULL but still
  selected by `findMetalsByOrderId`. `scrap.gem_id` is 100% NULL but still
  inserted by `insertScrapFromCartItem`. Do not drop without changing the code
  first.
- Naive timestamps throughout. Correct only because the container runs UTC,
  which is now pinned explicitly in both Dockerfiles rather than assumed.

### `NOT NULL` constraints are unassessed

Dev holds tens of rows, so dev null counts prove nothing. Needs
`pnpm --filter @dorado/api audit:nullability` against production. Blocked on the
`claude_ro` role, which fails authentication on every database on that instance
— `ALTER ROLE claude_ro PASSWORD '<the one in api/.env>';`

### Dead schema, unconfirmed

`auctions` and `auction_items` tables remain after the auction code was removed
in `19c7a532`. They hold data (1 and 10 rows in dev) and nothing references
them. Needs a yes/no before dropping, and a `pg_dump` first.

### The January copy dropped rows, and the count is not zero

Two gaps found while auditing orders, both closed by migration 028:

- one `purchase_order_item` (order 239, Received) never reached `orders.items`
- two purchase orders (241 and 242, both In Transit) carried an `address_id`
  that never became an `orders.addresses` row

Neither was visible from the schema - only from counting rows against the
source. Nothing was lost from `exchange`; the target was short. The lesson for
the remaining features is that shape parity is not row parity, and the copy
should be assumed incomplete until counted. The genesis backfill above makes
this moot for production, which will be populated from exchange directly rather
than inheriting January's copy.

### products.bullion.quantity left nullable

exchange.products declares `quantity` NOT NULL; `products.bullion` leaves it
nullable and migration 024 did not tighten it, unlike supplier_id, image_front,
image_back and stock which it did.

The others are restorations — nothing treats them as optional and a product
without a front image cannot render. `quantity` is a judgement: a
not-yet-stocked product could reasonably lack one, and exchange's NOT NULL may
be incidental rather than intended. Worth a decision rather than a default.

### Empty-string emails on carrier organizations

Two CARRIER rows in `organizations.organizations` hold `''` rather than NULL for
email. Postgres treats every NULL as distinct for uniqueness but two empty
strings as equal, so the placeholder actively defeats a constraint that would
otherwise be free. Found while scoping the refiner uniqueness in migration 020;
left alone because those rows belong to the shipping migration.

### BLOCKED: shipping.shipments is blocked behind services, and its copy is short

Audited in full. The structure is right and the copy is not.

**Which table is authoritative.** `shipping.shipments` and
`fulfillments.shipments` both exist and both hold rows, which looks like two
rival copies and is not. `shipping.shipments` keeps exchange's ids - all 17 of
them - and is the shipment. `fulfillments.shipments` shares no ids with
exchange at all; it is a link table joining a fulfillment to a shipment, with
the pickup and delivery locations. A shipment no longer points at its order
either: `fulfillments.fulfillments` does, one row per order.

**Seven of the thirteen reported gaps were renames** nobody had recorded -
est_delivery, label, cost, direction, tracking's `time`, and the two order id
columns being relocated rather than lost. All are now declared in
`scripts/audit-coverage.mjs`, verified against the data.

**Three real gaps are closed** by migration 046: shipping_status, pickup_type
and created_at, all populated on 23 of 23 rows.

**Three are blocked**, and they are what stops the feature:
`service_type`, `package` and `carrier_id` all route through
`shipping.services` and `shipping.packages`, which need the two decisions
below. `audit:coverage shipping` now prints them as BLOCKED rather than as
plain gaps.

**The copy is also incomplete, independently of the decisions:**

- 6 of exchange's 23 shipments were never copied (5 Inbound, 1 Outbound)
- the 6 tracking events missing from `shipping.tracking` all belong to those
  same 6 shipments, so it is one gap rather than two
- `shipping.tracking` holds **9 rows that do not exist in exchange at all** and
  are not duplicates of anything there. Where they came from is unknown. They
  must be understood before any backfill, because the guard that protects every
  other backfill reads exactly this condition as "exchange is no longer
  authoritative"
- 3 shipments have `cost = 0` where exchange has `net_charge = NULL` - the same
  null-defaulted-to-zero mistake found on orders.items.quantity

None of that is destructive - exchange holds all 23 - but the target cannot be
switched to until it is repaired, and repairing it is only worth doing once the
service and package questions are answered, since those change what a shipment
row is.

### Every other migrated feature was checked, and only addresses was missing

After 050 fixed it, all thirteen migrated features were audited for the same
gap. Every table their `repo.next` reads is registered in `verify-backfill`'s
TABLES list, so addresses was the only one.

The audit is now permanent rather than a one-off. `verify:backfill` asserts that
**every populated table in the new schema is either registered in TABLES or
declared in NOT_REBUILT with a reason** — seed data, a table compared through a
compat view, or a feature that is not migrated. A table that is neither is the
addresses bug again: migrated in code, never copied, and nothing checking.

Proved it can fail before trusting it: unregistering `leads.leads` produces
`leads.leads holds 39 rows, is not registered in TABLES, and is not declared in
NOT_REBUILT`. A check that has never been seen to fail is not evidence of
anything.

### addresses was migrated and never backfilled — fixed by 050

The addresses feature had a repo split, a dual-write, tests and a verified read
diff, and nothing ever copied the data. On a database built from `exchange`,
`places.addresses` would have held only per-order snapshots and the three shop
addresses, so every customer's saved address list would have come back empty.

Found by the shipping backfill, which references `places.addresses` for the
customer side of a shipment and had nothing to point at. Against dev nothing
looked wrong, because the rows were already there from January — the from-empty
check is the only thing that could have caught it, and did.

Worth taking as a general lesson: a feature is not migrated when its repo is
split. It is migrated when its data can be rebuilt from exchange and that has
been verified. Both order features, products, mints and the rest were caught by
`verify:backfill` registrations; addresses slipped through because nothing
registered it.

### fulfillments had to come before the shipping repo split

Worth recording as an ordering constraint rather than a surprise. All three
shipment reads are `SELECT *` from `exchange.shipments`, so the wire shape
includes `purchase_order_id` and `sales_order_id` — and `shipping.shipments` has
neither. `fulfillments.fulfillments.order_id` carries the order link, one row
per order, so a `repo.next` for shipments cannot return the shape it must until
fulfillments holds data. `getByOrder` in particular could not work at all.

052 backfills it: 23 fulfillments and 23 links, up from 17 and 16. Every order
with a shipment now has one, which closes the 6 that were missing — they were
the 6 whose shipments 049 had just restored, exactly as expected.

The mapping is derived rather than decided. Production holds two `pickup_type`
values and each corresponds exactly to a direction: 'Store Dropoff' on all 61
inbound, 'DropShip' on all 9 outbound. Status follows `shipping_status` —
Delivered becomes COMPLETED, anything else PENDING — which is what January's
sixteen rows already said.

Locations resolve by **type** rather than name: an inbound parcel is received at
the FEDEX_OFFICE location, an outbound one ships from the REFINER_OFFICE.
Renaming a location therefore cannot break the mapping.

One dev row contradicts itself and is excluded from the comparison: order
`1f3e9efe` is marked APPOINTMENT/SCHEDULED while having a DropShip shipment, and
only one fulfillment per order is allowed. A rebuild derives DROPSHIP from the
shipment, which is what the shipment says happened.

### A shipment's business location is not recorded in exchange

`shipping.shipments` requires a shipper and a recipient address, and
`exchange.shipments` has no address column at all. One side is derivable — the
customer's address, through the order — and 050 fills it.

The other is a business location — and it turns out the new schema records that
somewhere else. `fulfillments.shipments` carries `recipient_location_id` and
`shipper_location_id`, and 052 fills them: FEDEX_OFFICE for an inbound parcel,
REFINER_OFFICE for an outbound one.

So the shipment's own business-side address staying null is arguably correct
rather than merely cautious: the location that handled it is a fact about the
fulfillment, not about the label. 048 relaxing the constraint looks like the
right call for a better reason than the one it was made for.

Re-adding the constraint would now mean copying the location's address onto the
shipment, which duplicates what the fulfillment already says. Probably leave it.

### shipping.services and shipping.packages are seeded, not derived

Decided rather than asked, under Jacob's standing delegation, and reversible:
both are now in `047_seed_reference_data.sql` as literals.

They *could* be derived from `exchange.carrier_services`, which on production
holds the same eight (carrier, name) pairs. They are not, for two reasons. No id
is shared between the two tables, so deriving would re-key every service and
orphan anything already pointing at one. And dev's `carrier_services` holds two
of the eight, so the same migration would produce different results depending on
which database it ran against — which is exactly the class of mistake that put
the wrong conclusion in this file twice.

Seeding gives every database the eight services and six package sizes the
application expects. `shipping.carriers` keeps its exchange ids and those ids
are identical in dev and production, so the carrier references in the seed are
stable.

The shipments backfill therefore resolves `service_type` to a service by
(carrier, name) and `package` to a package by (carrier, label), rather than by
id. Every production value has a match: Express Saver, Priority Overnight,
Standard, Free and Overnight for services; Small Box, Medium Box and Large Box
for packages.

### shipping.services is NOT blocked — that entry was wrong

Recorded here for a while as needing two product decisions. Both were
artifacts of reasoning from dev, and production answers them.

Dev's `exchange.carrier_services` holds 2 rows. **Production holds 8**, and they
are the same eight as `shipping.services` — identical as sets on
(carrier, service name):

```
FedEx / Express Saver      UPS / Free
FedEx / Free               UPS / Overnight
FedEx / Overnight          UPS / Standard
FedEx / Priority Overnight
FedEx / Standard
```

So:

- **"Should `GET /carrier_services` start returning 8 instead of 2?"** It already
  returns 8 in production. Nothing changes.
- **"Is `2fb26257…` called Overnight or Priority Overnight?"** Production has
  *both*, as separate FedEx services. There is no rename and no conflict.

The one real difference is that the ids do not match — no id is shared between
the two tables. So the migration maps by `(carrier, name)` rather than by id,
which is exactly what the organizations backfill already does for suppliers,
carriers and mints.

Every `service_type` value used on production shipments — Express Saver (54),
Priority Overnight (7), Standard (7), Free (1), Overnight (1) — exists in
`carrier_services`. The earlier note claiming two of them did not was also
reading dev.

**Consequence: shipping.shipments is unblocked too**, since `service_type`,
`package` and `carrier_id` were only blocked behind this. What remains for
shipments is repair work, not decisions: 6 of production's shipments were never
copied, 3 have `cost = 0` where exchange has `NULL`, and `shipping.tracking`
holds 9 rows with no counterpart in exchange that still need explaining. And
fulfillments is blocked only behind shipments.

This is the second conclusion in this file that dev data got wrong, after the
bank details. Anything reasoned from dev row counts should be re-checked against
production before being believed — `audit:coverage:prod` and
`PROD_READONLY_DATABASE_URL` make that cheap now.

## Operations

### No production backup has been taken, and now there is more to back up

The agreed plan is a manual `pg_dump` before the **first** production migration
run. That has not happened, and nothing has been applied to production.

It matters more than it did. The chain is now 48 migrations that create sixteen
schemas, fill them from `exchange` and seed what `exchange` never held. All of
it is additive and `lint:migrations` proves no migration writes destructively to
`exchange` — but the dump is what makes that provable rather than argued, and it
is a one-liner.

### Docker images have never been built

No Docker daemon in the dev environment. Both Dockerfiles have been rewritten
for the workspace and moved to Node 24 without a single `docker build`. Worth
running once locally before the next deploy:

```
docker build -f api/Dockerfile .
docker build -f frontend/Dockerfile .

### Railway settings

Root Directory `/` on both services, `RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH` of
`api/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile`, Watch Paths per service. Confirmed
done. "Wait for CI" should be enabled once the workflow has run on master.

Worth revisiting now that `pnpm check` takes about two and a half minutes and
runs frontend tests as well: whatever timeout "Wait for CI" uses needs to allow
for that.

## Testing

**The money paths are covered.** Every repo function that moves money, prices
something, or deletes a row now has tests against real Postgres, each inside a
rolled-back transaction: rates, transactions (the checkout balance), carts,
sales tax, scrap, spots, products, orders, and the admin balance edit. What
remains untested is mostly read-only or belongs to a blocked feature —
`features/stripe/repo.js` (which should be tested for shape only, never by
calling Stripe) and `features/reviews/repo.exchange.js`.

**No swallowed errors remain.** A sweep of every `catch` in `features/` and
`shared/` found none that is empty or that neither rethrows, logs, nor responds.
The one that hid the August checkout outage for months was the last of them.

- The frontend now has vitest and 53 tests, covering rate resolution (mirrored
  1:1 from the API and previously tested on only one side), weight conversion
  (mirrored *three* ways), the scrap price, the declared value on a shipping
  label, the client-side scrap naming, date formatting, and the address id
  checkout posts back. That is a start on 42k lines, not coverage.
- No browser or e2e harness, deliberately. Anything that renders a component
  needs a DOM implementation and a testing library, which is a decision rather
  than a config change.
- API repo tests now cover leads, suppliers, products, mints, purchase-orders,
  sales-orders and addresses. Most other repo functions are still untested.
- Nothing tests routes, middleware or auth end to end.
- `api/features/rates/utils/resolveRate.js` still points at
  `apps/frontend/features/rates/utils/resolveRate.ts` in its header comment —
  a path that stopped existing when the workspace was flattened to `frontend/`.
