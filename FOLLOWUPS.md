# Follow-ups

Things found and deliberately deferred, with enough context to pick up cold.
Ordered roughly by how much they'd cost if left.

## Production: the schema and eleven features' data can now get there

`000_genesis_schema.sql` creates all 16 schemas, 45 tables, 4 views, 4 enum
types and 1 function from nothing. `029_genesis_backfill.sql` fills the tables
belonging to the eleven migrated features from exchange.

Both are verified by building into renamed schemas inside a rolled-back
transaction: `verify:genesis` compares the structure against dev column by
column, `verify:backfill` runs the backfill into empty tables and compares the
rows, re-runs it to prove idempotency, and checks that it refuses once the new
schema holds a row exchange does not.

Genesis is generated - `pnpm --filter @dorado/api dump:schema`. Edit the
generator, never the SQL.

### What is still not populated

**The other features' tables.** orders, payments, fulfillments,
shipping.shipments/tracking/pickups, places, and the refiners item/spot tables.
Their features still read exchange so empty costs nothing, but each needs
transformation work checked against a read-for-read diff first. They should be
backfilled as each feature is migrated, not in a batch.

**The seed data, which has no source in exchange at all.** These are new facts
about the business rather than a reshaping of old ones, so they cannot be
derived and must be written as literals:

- the DORADO organization (the business itself) and `places.locations` /
  `places.location_hours`, which reference it
- `fulfillments.methods` (11 rows), `payments.methods` (10)
- `shipping.services` (8) and `shipping.packages` (9) - also blocked on the
  product decision below
- `auth.employees` (2)

Worth doing as one seed migration, taking the values from dev. Until then a
production database would have the tables and none of these rows.

### 35 populated columns still have no home, and they are now known in advance

`pnpm --filter @dorado/api audit:coverage` reports, for every source table,
which populated columns have no destination in the schema it maps onto. It was
written because orders turned out to be missing twenty-one columns of live data,
found one repo function at a time, after the row counts had matched and the
shapes looked plausible.

The eleven migrated features are clean. What remains, to be fixed *before* each
feature's repo is split rather than during it:

- **shipping — 13 columns.** `exchange.shipments` has essentially nothing mapped:
  shipping_status, service_type, type, carrier_id, package, pickup_type,
  net_charge, shipping_label, estimated_delivery, created_at and both order id
  columns, all populated. Plus `tracking_events.scan_time`, 72 of 72. The
  shipping tables are the emptiest sketch of the lot.
- **payments — 18 columns.** `payment_intents` is almost entirely unmapped
  (payment_intent_id, payment_status, type, user_id, amounts, and the card and
  bank descriptors), and `payouts` is missing order_id, method,
  account_holder_name and cost.
- **refiners — 4 columns**, the same four added to orders.spots by 035:
  scrap_percentage, bullion_percentage, created_at, updated_at. Migration 035
  already added them to `refiners.spots`; they are listed here because the
  refiners feature has not been backfilled yet, so its table is still empty.

The audit only proves a mapping *exists*, not that it is right. It is a floor.

### The order address id is the address-book id, not the snapshot's

`orders.addresses` points at a snapshot in `places.addresses` and also records
`source_address_id`, the address-book row it was copied from. The order read
returns the source id, because the frontend posts `address.id` back at checkout
and the API resolves it with `addressService.getAddressFromId`, which reads
`exchange.addresses`. A snapshot id does not resolve there.

That is right for now and wrong eventually. Once the addresses feature moves and
`getAddressFromId` reads `places.addresses`, the snapshot id should become the
one returned - it is the address the order was actually placed against, frozen.
Revisit when places is migrated; there is a test pinning the current behaviour.

### sales_orders.shipping_service was left behind deliberately

The one column of the twenty-one that migration 033 did not give a home. It
names a carrier service, and `shipping.shipments` already has `service_type`
for what looks like the same thing - but `exchange.shipments.service_type` holds
values that `exchange.carrier_services` does not contain, which is the same
tangle that blocks `shipping.services` below. Deciding whether the order's
service and the shipment's service are one field belongs with the shipping
migration, so it waits for that.

Populated on all 15 sales orders, so it cannot simply be dropped.

### A purchase order's refiner is not recorded in exchange

`orders.orders.refinery_id` is set on all sixteen purchase orders in dev, all to
Elemetal. `exchange.purchase_orders` has no supplier column, and
`exchange.refiner_metals` has none either, so there is nothing to derive it
from - it is a fact someone knew in January and wrote down.

The backfill leaves it null for purchases rather than asserting Elemetal of
every purchase order on production because it happened to be true of sixteen in
dev. Sales orders are fine: they carry `supplier_id` and it maps straight
across.

Needs a decision. If every purchase order really does go to one refiner, say so
and the backfill can set it; if not, it is only recoverable from whatever
records exist outside the database.

### reviews.user_id cannot be reconstructed

`exchange.reviews` records a name and no user reference. dev's `reviews.user_id`
was filled in January by matching that name, but exchange.users now holds two
accounts named Jacob Johnson and every review in dev is under that name, so the
match is ambiguous and the backfill leaves it null rather than guessing. If the
link matters, it needs a deliberate decision about which account is the
reviewer - it is not recoverable from the data.

## Security

### The audit trail is forgeable — and the fix is server-only

The frontend sends `user_name: user?.name` in the request body, and the API
writes it to `created_by` / `updated_by` verbatim. Any authenticated admin can
attribute an action to anyone by editing one field.

`req.user.id` and `req.user.name` are already available from `requireAuth` and
are used for audit in **zero** places.

**No frontend change is needed.** The server keeps accepting the field and
simply stops trusting it — read the actor from the session instead. The
frontend can go on sending `user_name`; it just gets ignored. 53 call sites
across 23 API files pass `user_name` today.

Until this is done, the new `created_by_id` columns are a trustworthy column
filled from an untrusted source.

### Bank details are unencrypted at rest

`exchange.payouts.routing_number` and `.account_number` are plaintext `text`,
written straight from `req.body` by `insertPayout`. Order responses no longer
carry them — only last-4, with full values behind an admin-only endpoint — but
the storage is unchanged.

Deferred by Jacob. Worth checking whether prod actually holds any: if ACH and
Wire have never been used, these columns are vestigial and the answer is to drop
them rather than build encryption.

```sql
SELECT method, count(*), count(routing_number), count(account_number)
FROM exchange.payouts GROUP BY method;
```

## Schema

### The API doesn't populate the new audit id columns

`created_by_id` / `updated_by_id` exist on 14 new-schema tables and are
backfilled, but dual-write only mirrors the text columns, so new rows get null.
Ties into the session-actor fix above — do them together.

### Latent defects in `exchange`, not worth fixing there

Recorded because the same mistakes should not be carried into the new schema:

- `exchange.addresses.state` defaults to `'United States'`; `country` has no
  default. The pair is transposed. No rows affected — the app always supplies
  both — and `places.addresses` already has it the right way round.
- `exchange.leads.contact` defaults to the literal `'Jacob Johnson'`.
- `order_metals.percent_change` and `dollar_change` are 100% NULL but still
  selected by `findMetalsByOrderId`. `scrap.gem_id` is 100% NULL but still
  inserted by `insertScrapFromCartItem`. Do not drop without changing the code
  first.
- Naive timestamps throughout. Correct only because the container runs UTC,
  which is now pinned explicitly in both Dockerfiles rather than assumed.

### `NOT NULL` constraints are unassessed

Dev holds tens of rows, so dev null counts prove nothing. Needs
`pnpm --filter @dorado/api audit:nullability` against production. Blocked on the
`claude_ro` role, which fails authentication on every database on that instance
— `ALTER ROLE claude_ro PASSWORD '<the one in api/.env>';`

### Dead schema, unconfirmed

`auctions` and `auction_items` tables remain after the auction code was removed
in `19c7a532`. They hold data (1 and 10 rows in dev) and nothing references
them. Needs a yes/no before dropping, and a `pg_dump` first.

### The January copy dropped rows, and the count is not zero

Two gaps found while auditing orders, both closed by migration 028:

- one `purchase_order_item` (order 239, Received) never reached `orders.items`
- two purchase orders (241 and 242, both In Transit) carried an `address_id`
  that never became an `orders.addresses` row

Neither was visible from the schema - only from counting rows against the
source. Nothing was lost from `exchange`; the target was short. The lesson for
the remaining features is that shape parity is not row parity, and the copy
should be assumed incomplete until counted. The genesis backfill above makes
this moot for production, which will be populated from exchange directly rather
than inheriting January's copy.

### products.bullion.quantity left nullable

exchange.products declares `quantity` NOT NULL; `products.bullion` leaves it
nullable and migration 024 did not tighten it, unlike supplier_id, image_front,
image_back and stock which it did.

The others are restorations — nothing treats them as optional and a product
without a front image cannot render. `quantity` is a judgement: a
not-yet-stocked product could reasonably lack one, and exchange's NOT NULL may
be incidental rather than intended. Worth a decision rather than a default.

### Empty-string emails on carrier organizations

Two CARRIER rows in `organizations.organizations` hold `''` rather than NULL for
email. Postgres treats every NULL as distinct for uniqueness but two empty
strings as equal, so the placeholder actively defeats a constraint that would
otherwise be free. Found while scoping the refiner uniqueness in migration 020;
left alone because those rows belong to the shipping migration.

### BLOCKED: shipping.services needs a product decision before it can move

`shipping.services` is not a copy of `exchange.carrier_services` — it is a
correction of it, and migrating either way changes what the API returns.

What the data says:

- `exchange.carrier_services` holds **2** rows: Express Saver and Overnight,
  both FedEx.
- `exchange.shipments.service_type` stores the service *name as text*, and the
  values in use are Express Saver (16), **Standard** (6) and **Free** (1) —
  two of which do not exist in `carrier_services` at all.
- `shipping.services` holds **8**: Free, Overnight, Standard per carrier for
  FedEx and UPS, plus Express Saver and Priority Overnight for FedEx. The
  apparent duplicates are per-carrier, which is correct.
- The frontend hardcodes both spellings: `salesOrders/types.ts` uses
  `'Overnight'`, `service/types.ts` uses `serviceDescription: 'Priority
  Overnight'`.

So the old table was never the source of truth — the real service list lives in
the frontend, and `carrier_services` drifted into holding a fragment of it.

**Two decisions needed:**

1. Should `GET /carrier_services` start returning 8 rows instead of 2? It is
   additive and arguably a fix, but it is a visible change to whatever lists
   services.
2. The id `2fb26257-65a3-4922-98d2-a9726a9b5167` is named `Overnight` in
   exchange and `Priority Overnight` in shipping. Same row, two names. Which is
   correct? FedEx's actual product is Priority Overnight, so the new name looks
   right — but `exchange.shipments.service_type` matches on the name, so
   renaming affects how existing shipments resolve.

Until both are answered, migrating services would either discard the more
complete list or silently change displayed service names. `shipping.packages` is
fed from the same source and is blocked behind the same questions.

## Operations

### No production backup has been taken

The agreed plan is a manual `pg_dump` before the **first** production migration
run. That has not happened yet, and nothing has been applied to production.

### Docker images have never been built

No Docker daemon in the dev environment. Both Dockerfiles have been rewritten
for the workspace and moved to Node 24 without a single `docker build`. Worth
running once locally before the next deploy:

```
docker build -f api/Dockerfile .
docker build -f frontend/Dockerfile .
```

### Railway settings

Root Directory `/` on both services, `RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH` of
`api/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile`, Watch Paths per service. Confirmed
done. "Wait for CI" should be enabled once the workflow has run on master.

## Testing

- The frontend has **no tests at all** — 42k lines, zero.
- Repo tests exist only for `leads`. ~150 other repo functions are untested.
- Nothing tests routes, middleware or auth end to end.
